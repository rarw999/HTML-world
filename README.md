# HTML-world
## Full of HTML games, OS's, and more. A students dream...

This is a work in progress. I will only add things fully compatible with chromebooks and however I'm to lazy to add instructions...
so you might have to know how to download and run a simple file to use these HTML games, OS's, ect

It's very likely that I will add things daily/weekly.

### I hope you enjoy 
 
 # DISCLAIMER:
 #### I don't care about what school districts say. Students will find one way or another to get games/other
 ###### You can download this for a reason... (If I have to take down anyone could put it back up)
